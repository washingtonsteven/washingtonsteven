### I am a game and full-stack web developer in Boston, MA.

<div class="profile" style="background-image:url(/assets/2018/02/me.jpg)">
</div>

I like making awesome sites, tools, and games!

I'm also always on the look out for new things to cram into my head-hole. Some of those things are:

{% include skills-module.html %}

{% include projects-module.html %}
